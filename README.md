# XACMET
XACML Modeling &amp; Testing




XACMET is a generator of XACML requests as well as an automated model-based oracle.

The main features of XACMET are:


 <ul>
  <li>definition of a typed graph, called the XAC-Graph, that models the XACML policy evaluation;</li>
  <li>derivation of a set of test requests via full-path coverage of this graph;</li>
  <li>automatic derivation of the expected verdict of a specific request execution by executing the corresponding path in such graph;</li>
  <li>finally, XACMET allows to measure coverage assessment of a given test suite.</li>
</ul>
